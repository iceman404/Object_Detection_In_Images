## Object_Detection_In_Images
Task Description:

Object Detection in Images:-
```
You are tasked with building an object detection model for a self-driving car project. The dataset
provided contains images from a front-facing camera mounted on a car, and it includes various
objects such as pedestrians, cars, and traffic signs.
Your goal is to develop a deep learning model for object detection using convolutional neural
networks (CNNs). Please follow the steps below:
Data Exploration:
● Load and explore the dataset. Provide insights into the distribution of classes and
any preprocessing steps you think are necessary.
Model Development:
● Choose a suitable pre-trained CNN architecture (e.g., VGG16, ResNet, or
MobileNet) for transfer learning.
● Fine-tune the selected model on the given dataset for object detection. Implement
any necessary modifications, such as adding a region proposal network (RPN) or
adjusting the output layer for bounding box predictions.
Evaluation:
● Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
● Train your model on the training set and evaluate its performance on the testing
set.
● Use appropriate evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score for each
class.
```

Visualization:
```
● Provide visualizations of the model's predictions on a few sample images. Include
bounding boxes and class labels.
Optimization:
● Suggest at least one strategy to optimize the model's performance. This could
include hyperparameter tuning, data augmentation, or model architecture
adjustments.
Communication:
● Write a brief report summarizing your approach, key findings, and potential areas
for improvement. Assume you will be presenting this report to a non-technical
audience.
```

Submission Guidelines:
```
● Submit your code along with comments explaining each step.
● Include a written report detailing your approach, results, and any challenges faced.
Note:
● You can use any deep learning framework you are comfortable with (e.g., TensorFlow,
PyTorch).
● Feel free to make any reasonable assumptions if certain details are not provided.
